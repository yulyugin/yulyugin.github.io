\section*{Machine Learning}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{Behrouz:Titans:2024}:

    The authors present Titans --- a new machine learning model architecture that incorporates long-term memory with forgetting in order to be able to handle very large context windows. A forgetting mechanism is added to the model to avoid memory overflows. Long-term memory is added as a context to the current input sequence.
