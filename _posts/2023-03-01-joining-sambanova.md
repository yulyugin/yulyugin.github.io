![SambaNova logo]{: style="float: left; width: 10%; padding: 1%"} Today I can finally open that I joined [SambaNova Systems](https://sambanova.ai/) right after [leaving Intel]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2022/farewell-to-intel). The company is building advanced software, hardware and services to run AI applications. Unfortunately I can't tell more about the amazing technologies created by the company but I can share a couple of links for those who are interested in a bit more details.
