![Book]{: style="float: left; width: 10%; padding: 1%"} Last year was bad in terms of paper reading. I read just 18 new papers that are worse mentioning.
There is a positive shift though - I started to summarize all the papers I read in [BibTeX-based catalogue]({{ site.baseurl }}/bibliography).
A really short summary of all the papers organized by research topics is provided below.
